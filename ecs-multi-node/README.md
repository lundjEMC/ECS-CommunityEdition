# ECS SW 2.0 Multiple Nodes Deployments

Welcome to the Multiple Nodes installation for ECS Software 2.0. We have provided the following deployment options: 


- **[ECS Multiple Nodes Docker Deployment](https://github.com/EMCECS/ECS-CommunityEdition/blob/master/Documentation/ECS-MultiNode-Instructions.md "ECS Multiple Node Docker Deployment Information")**
- **[ECS Docker Multi Node Deployment using Docker Machine, Docker Swarm, & Docker Compose](https://github.com/emccode/ecs-dockerswarm/ "ECS Docker Multi Node Deployment using Docker Machine, Docker Swarm, & Docker Compose Deployment Information")**
- **[ECS Multiple Nodes Puppet Deployment](https://github.com/EMCECS/ECS-CommunityEdition/blob/master/Documentation/ECS-MultiNode-Puppet-Instructions.md "ECS Multiple Node Puppet Deployment Information")**


## Requirements

The Host Machines should have these following minimum requirements: 

- **Operative system:** CentOS 7
- **CPU/Cores:** 4 Cores
- **Memory:** Minimum of 50 GB RAM (64 GB recommended)
- **Disks:** An unpartitioned/Raw disk with at least 100 GB of Storage per disk per host. Multiple disks can be attached on each ECS Node to increase capacity and performance. Each disk need to be un-partitioned before running the installation scripts.

We have performed testing against the following platform(s): 

|Deployment Type | OS Name | Version | Docker Version |
|----------------|-------|---------|----------------|
| Docker + Scripts |CentOS	| 7.1	  | 1.4.1          |
| Docker Compose |Ubuntu	| 14	  | 1.5          |
| Puppet |CentOS	| 7.1	  | 1.4.1          |
